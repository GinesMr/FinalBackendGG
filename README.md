# OrbitWallet Backend

This repository contains the backend source code of **OrbitWallet**, a non-custodial Ethereum wallet developed by **Ginés Martínez Ruiz** as part of a final academic project. The backend is written in **Go (Golang)** using the **Gin** web framework and is responsible for handling wallet interactions, blockchain queries, and secure operations.

---

## Overview

OrbitWallet is designed to demonstrate key backend concepts such as:

- Secure generation of Ethereum wallet data
- Blockchain communication via APIs
- Clean and modular backend architecture
- Integration with public Ethereum testnets (Sepolia)

This backend interacts with both the mobile client (built in Flutter) and external APIs.
